# Secret club message board

This is an exercise for The Odin Project. Got a chance to learn more about authentication, mongoose and tailwind (by choice). 

## Features

The messages are visible to anyone. To send a message you need to create an account and to see the messages' authors, you then need to become a club member. 
I made a silly challenge to get access to the club. 

Jane Doe is the only administrator, but a user can become an administrator with a password. Admins can delete messages. 

## Extras

I worked on a pagination feature which probably needs work to become more efficient. The page is responsive and it was the first time I used tailwind with that in mind, which made it a lot quicker.

I'm happy with the final result.
